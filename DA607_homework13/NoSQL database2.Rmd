## NoSQL migration

Assignment:

For this assignment, you should take information from a relational database and migrate it to a NoSQL database of your own choosing. 

For the relational database, you might use the flights database, the tb database, the "data skills" database your team created for Project 3, or another database of your own choosing or creation.

For the NoSQL database, you may use MongoDB (which we introduced in week 7), Neo4j, or another NoSQL database of your choosing.

Your migration process needs to be reproducible.  R code is encouraged, but not required.  You should also briefly describe the advantages and disadvantages of storing the data in a relational database vs. your NoSQL database.

Overview:

I will migrate the movie_rating database generated in week_2 homework to Neo4j. Nodes will be created first followed by buiding relationships. At last the graph will be viewed with visualization tool.

```{r,eval=F}
devtools::install_github("nicolewhite/Rneo4j") 
install.packages("RMySQL")
```

```{r}
library(RMySQL)
library(RNeo4j)
library(knitr)
```

## Get the Data from MySQL
```{r, echo= F}
mysql_pw <- "5201"
```

```{r}
# connect to MySQL local database
movie_con <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user="root", password=mysql_pw, dbname = "movie_nosql", host = "localhost")
```


```{r}
#Send query to MySQL and retrieve the movie data from MySQL.
query.movie <- dbSendQuery(movie_con, "SELECT * FROM movie")
movie.data <- dbFetch(query.movie, n=-1)

#Send query to MySQL and retrieve the friends data from MySQL. Friends are the people who rated the movies
query.friends <- dbSendQuery(movie_con, "SELECT * FROM friends")
friends.data <- dbFetch(query.friends, n=-1)

#Send query to MySQL and retrieve the rating data from MySQL.
query.rating <- dbSendQuery(movie_con, "SELECT * FROM rating")
rating.data <- dbFetch(query.rating, n=-1)

#send query to MySQL and retrieve the actor data from MySQL
query.actor <- dbSendQuery(movie_con, "SELECT * FROM actor")
actor.data <- dbFetch(query.actor, n=-1)

#send query to MySQL and retrieve the director data from MySQL
query.director <- dbSendQuery(movie_con, "SELECT * FROM director")
director.data <- dbFetch(query.director, n=-1)
#send query to MySQL and retrieve the writer data from MySQL
query.writer <- dbSendQuery(movie_con, "SELECT * FROM writer")
writer.data <- dbFetch(query.writer, n=-1)

#send query to MySQL and retrieve the genre data from MySQL
query.genre <- dbSendQuery(movie_con, "SELECT * FROM genre")
genre.data <- dbFetch(query.genre, n=-1)

#send query to MySQL and retrieve the country data from MySQL
query.country <- dbSendQuery(movie_con, "SELECT * FROM country")
country.data <- dbFetch(query.country, n=-1)

#send query to MySQL and retrieve the country data from MySQL
query.omdb <- dbSendQuery(movie_con, "SELECT * FROM omdb")
omdb.data <- dbFetch(query.omdb, n=-1)


kable(head(rating.data, n=7), caption = "Rating - the main table")

kable(head(movie.data, n=6),caption = "Movie Table")
kable(head(friends.data, n=5), caption = "Audience Table")
kable(head(actor.data, n=5),caption = "Actor Table")
kable(head(director.data, n=5),caption = "Director Table")

**Export data as .csv files**
```{r}
write.csv(movie.data, "movie.csv")
write.csv(friends.data, "friends.csv")
write.csv(rating.data, "rating.csv")
write.csv(actor.data, "actor.csv")
write.csv(director.data, "director.csv")

write.csv(genre.data, "genre.csv")
write.csv(country.data, "country.csv")
write.csv(omdb.data, "omdb.csv")
```

**Disconnect from MySQL**
```{r}
dbDisconnect(movie_con)
```

## Load the data to Neo4j

**Download .csv files**

```{r}
friends_d <- read.csv(file="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YunMai-SPS/DA607/master/DA607_homework13/friends.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", stringsAsFactors = F)

```


```{r,echo=F}
neo4j.pw <- "data607"
```


##  Migration to Neo4j
## 1. Create graph in Neo4j
```{r}
#connect to Neo4j
graph = startGraph("http://localhost:7474/db/data", username = "neo4j", password = neo4j.pw)

#delete all nodes, relationships, indexes, and constraints from the graph database
clear(graph, input = F)

# nodes to be created: 
# Nodes:
#   movie              
#   audience          
#   actor             
#   director                
#   writer              
#   genre
#   country
# the same nodes will be merged.


query = "
         MERGE (movie:Movie {name: {title1}, id:{movieid1}})
         CREATE (audience:Audience {name:{audname},id1:{audid},id2:{movieid2}, rating:{friendrating}})
         CREATE (audience)-[r:RATED]->(movie)
         SET r.rating = {friendrating}
         RETURN audience,movie         
"
tx = newTransaction(graph)
for (i in 1:nrow(rating_d)){
    appendCypher(tx,query,
                title1 = rating_d$MovieName[i],
                movieid1 = rating_d$MovieID[i],
                audname = rating_d$FriendName[i],
                audid = rating_d$FriendID[i],
                movieid2 = rating_d$MovieID[i],
                friendrating = rating_d$FriendRating[i])
               
}
commit(tx)

summary(graph)

```

I used MATCH clauses in the above query to create relationships but error occured. It seemed that Neo4j did not allow to have multiple statements within a query. Then I removed MATCH clauses but only kept CREAT clause to create relationship. 

Then I attempted to create relationships and nodes with different lables in separate queries using the same approach but did not work. 

I tried to fix the porblem but without sucess. Sometime the error message is: the newTransaction(graph) has expired. 

This following code chunk did not work. The error is: Error in appendCypher.transaction(tx, query) : Neo.ClientError.Statement.SyntaxError Invalid input ')': expected whitespace, '.', node labels, '[', "=~", IN, STARTS, ENDS, CONTAINS, IS, '^', '*', '/', '%', '+', '-', '=', "<>", "!=", '<', '>', "<=", ">=", AND, XOR, OR, ',' or '}' (line 2, column 50 (offset: 60))  "CREATE (actor:Actor {name:{actname}, id:{actorid}), title:{movietitle})" ^".

So I put them as statements for further troubleshooting in the future.
```{r}
# query = "
#         MATCH (movie:Movie {id:{movieid1}})
#         MATCH (audience:Audience {id1:{audid})
#         CREATE (audience)-[r:RATED]->(movie)
#         SET r.rating = {friendrating}
#         RETURN audience,movie         
#"


#tx = newTransaction(graph)
#for (i in 1:nrow(actor_d)){
#  appendCypher(tx,query,
#                actname = actor_d$actors[i],
#                actorid = actor_d$actorID[i],
#                movietitle = actor_d$title[i],
#                title1 = actor_d$title[i])
#}
#commit(tx)

# query = "
#         CREATE (actor:Actor {name:{actname}, id:{actorid}), #title:{movietitle})
#         MATCH (movie:Movie {name: {title1}})
#         MATCH (actor:Actor {name:{actname}})
#         CREATE (actor)-[a:ACTED_IN]->(movie)
#"
#tx = newTransaction(graph)
#appendCypher(tx,query)
#commit(tx)
```


**Since I could not create relationship and more nodes. I tried a different way to create graphes.**

## 2.1 Create Nodes with RNeo4j functions

```{r}

```


## 2.2 Create the relationship with RNeo4j functions

** 2.2.1. Relationship between audiences and movies**
```{r}
movie_query = "

```

**2.2.4 Relationship between writers and movies**
```{r}

    createRel(writer_related, "WROTE", movie_rated)
}
summary(graph)
```

**2.2.5 Relationship between genres and movies**
```{r}

"
genre_query = "
MATCH(b:Genre) WHERE b.movietitle={movietitle} AND b.name={name}

**2.2.6 Relationship between countries and movies**
```{r}

    createRel(movie_rated, "PRODUCED_IN", country_related)
}
summary(graph)
```


tabular results could be returned by using Cypher. As introduced in Nicole White's GitHub RNeo4j repo "https://github.com/nicolewhite/RNeo4j#nodes"
```{r}
query = "
MATCH (audience:Audience)-[RATED]-(movie:Movie {title: 'Beauty and the Beast'}) 
RETURN audience.name, Type(RATED), RATED"

cypher(graph, query)
```

```{r}
query = "
MATCH (audience:Audience)-[r:RATED]->(movie:Movie)
WHERE audience.name = 'Ming'
RETURN audience.name, r.rating, movie.name
"
cypher(graph, query)
```

When returning relative more complicated results:
```{r}
query = "
MATCH (audience:Audience)-[r:RATED]->(movie:Movie)
WHERE audience.name = 'Ming'
RETURN audience.name, COLLECT(movie.movie) AS seen
"

cypherToList(graph, query)

```


Parameters can be passed
```{r}
query = "
MATCH (audience:Audience)-[r:RATED]-> (movie:Movie)
WHERE audience.name = {name1} AND movie:movie = {title1}
RETURN audience.name, r.rating, movie:movie
"

cypher(graph, query, name1="Hao", title1="The Fate of the Furious")
```


## Browse Neo4j Graph
```{r}
graph = startGraph("http://localhost:7474/db/data/", username="neo4j", password=neo4j.pw)
browse(graph)
```

My Rstudio somehow cannot show Neo4j browser. Cypher clauses will be put in Neo4j to build the database. One of the graphes is attached(atudience-rate-movie).
